# Nadir Assembler
Where the ZenithOS aims for the stars, this program targets low level embedded
processors like AVR and ARM. This is a small experimental project to create
a simple assembler that can be easily reassigned with tables to any processor
architecture. What is learned could hopefully be used to better understand
and modify the Zenith compiler backend to easily support multiple architectures.
